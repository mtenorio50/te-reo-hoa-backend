# Progress Log

## 17 June 2025

### New Features Implemented

- **Word of the Day:**  
  Implemented a daily rotating word endpoint that serves a random word with full details to all registered users.

- **User Progress Tracking:**  
  Added endpoints and data model for users to mark words as "learned", "to review", "starred", and "unlearned".  
  Included a stats endpoint for users to see their progress counts and list their learned words.

- **Quiz/Practice Endpoints:**  
  Added quiz endpoints for multiple-choice vocabulary practice, including answer checking and scoring logic.

- **Search & Filter Words:**  
  Users can now search and filter vocabulary by level, type, domain, and text.

- **Positive News Feed:**  
  Integrated `/news/` endpoint that fetches M훮ori news from RNZ Te Ao M훮ori and Te Ao M훮ori News,  
  then uses Google Gemini AI to filter and return only positive, uplifting stories.  
  Each news item includes title, link, summary, thumbnail, and category.
